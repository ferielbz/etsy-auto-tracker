### 🛍️ Etsy Competitor Tracker (Python + Selenium + PDF)

This project is a smart monitoring tool for Etsy shops. It automates the process of tracking any competitor's store daily and gives a clean summary of what's new.

**Features:**
- Extracts the 5 most recent products (name, price, and link)
- Tracks total sales and extracts names of the 5 latest sales
- Automatically scrolls and navigates like a human
- Detects and waits for manual CAPTCHA solving if needed
- Generates a professional PDF report using `fpdf`
- Built with `undetected-chromedriver` to bypass Etsy's bot detection
- Easy-to-use graphical interface with `tkinter`
  
Make sure the file DejaVuSans.ttf is in the same folder.

📎 Example Output
A PDF file named etsy_tracker_report.pdf will be generated with the tracking results.
